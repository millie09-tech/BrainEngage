# BrainEngage
A passion project that attempts to make popular games easier to use for children with special needs. We are using the popular but simple game Pac-Man to encourage students to learn using a reward-based system.  By using this technology we can help those with ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, etc. 

HOW?
In a presentation by Sophia Corson, she referenced a paper that proved the relationship between FDA-approved video games and positive social interaction between neurotypical and neurodivergent children Video games could help children with ASD become better with social interactions. Not only children with special needs, but also most people around respond better to positive feedbacks like rewards as compared to negative ones. This is because positive feedback stimulates hormones like dopamine and oxytocin also known as ‘feel-good hormones’ that makes a human brain feel calm and happy. 

FEATURES TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS: 
We formatted the program such that it was easy for the special needs kids to navigate through. For example using fonts like Courier Prime. We also have a help/positive affirmations page on the study website whenever the user feels stuck. And as for the reward, we decided to add videogames at the end in order to encourage the user to finish studying.
